# Convolutional_Neural_Network-MNIST
I created a convolutional neural network to identify handwritten digits. It takes in an image of a handwritten number from 0-9 and outputs its prediction of which number it is. The neural network is about 99% accurate in identifying the correct number.

The images used are from the MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) of handwritten digits.
